# Validator Types

Sometimes a value can be built just fine but still not make sense — a shape with a negative area, a dice roll outside its range. Deor's answer is the **validator type**: a type with its own built-in rule for what counts as valid. Write the rule once, and every place that type is used, the rule runs automatically — there's no way to hold one of these values without it having been checked.

A validator type is declared with `type`:

```deor
type Positive(int val)
    val > 0
```

This defines `Positive`, built on `int`, with one rule: greater than zero. Assigning an `int` runs the rule — pass, and you have a valid `Positive`; fail, and instead of a crash or a garbage value, you get a `Positive` that's explicitly **not valid**, which the language forces you to check before use.

(Rust readers: under the hood this is `Option<T>` — valid is `Some`, not valid is `None`.) See [Types](docs/types.md) for primitives, `raw` variables, and structs.

## Declaration

**The predicate body is mandatory** — a `type` with no rule means nothing more than its base type, so the transpiler rejects an empty body. Just use the base type directly if you don't need a check.

The base type must be a primitive (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`) — structs, list shapes, and other validator types (including the type referencing itself) are not valid as a validator base type and are transpiler errors:

```deor
type Foo(int val)          # correct — primitive base type
type Foo(intList val)      # transpiler error — list shapes cannot be validator base types
type Foo(Point val)        # transpiler error — structs cannot be validator base types
type Foo(Foo val)          # transpiler error — a validator type cannot reference itself
```

The parameter name cannot shadow the type name or its own base type — both are transpiler errors:

```deor
type Roll(int Roll)    # transpiler error — parameter name shadows the type name
type Roll(int int)     # transpiler error — parameter name shadows its base type
type Roll(int val)     # correct
```

The body evaluates to a `bool` — a single expression for simple predicates, or intermediate bindings followed by a final bool expression for more complex ones, same rules as a function body.

Plain primitives and structs can never be "missing" — only validator types carry that possibility, and only because the predicate runs on assignment.

**Only the full declaration form re-runs the predicate.** `TypeName varName = expr` triggers validation; a later bare reassignment (`varName = expr`) or `as` binding does not, and both are transpiler errors. To re-validate a new value — retrying input in a loop, for example — declare it fresh each time:

```deor
for if true
    (first) in input()
    Roll attempt = c_string_to_int(first)   # fresh declaration each iteration
    if attempt is valid
        return (avow attempt)
    else
        print("invalid, try again")
```

This kind of shadowing across loop iterations is the normal pattern — a fresh "construct and check" each time, not a one-time declaration you update.

A slightly more realistic predicate, using values from an earlier calculation:

```deor
# import lib/math.deor and lib/convert.deor for these functions
type Squarefeet(int val)
    float flt = c_int_to_float(val)
    float root = m_sqrt(flt)
    int root_i = m_floor(root)
    return root_i * root_i is val
```

`c_int_to_float`, `m_sqrt`, and `m_floor` come from `lib/convert.deor` and `lib/math.deor` (see [Libs](docs/libs.md)). A negative `val` makes `m_sqrt` return NaN, `m_floor` turns that into `0`, and `0 * 0 is val` fails — no separate negative-number guard needed.

```deor
Squarefeet area = 9     # valid — predicate passes
Squarefeet area = -1    # transpiles and compiles fine — not valid only at runtime
```

---

## `is valid` / `is not valid`

A validator type variable is always **valid** (rule passed) or **not valid** (rule failed, or nothing assigned yet) — `Some`/`None` for Rust readers. There's no keyword to force an invalid state; it happens in exactly two ways:

- Declared without a value: `Squarefeet sqft` — not valid until assigned
- Assigned a value that fails the predicate: `Squarefeet sqft = -10` — predicate fails, not valid

Check with `is valid` / `is not valid`:

```deor
Squarefeet sqft = 9
if sqft is valid
    int val = (avow sqft)
if sqft is not valid
    print("no value")
```

This is Deor's only concept of null — see [Replacing Null and Undefined](#replacing-null-and-undefined) for the pattern and why.

---

## Declaring Without a Value

A validator type variable declared without an initial value starts as not valid. Assign a value later to make it valid.

```deor
Roll best
Squarefeet area
```

```rust
let mut best: Option<Roll> = None;
let mut area: Option<Squarefeet> = None;
```

`empty` is not valid for validator types and is a transpiler error — not valid is expressed by declaring without a value instead:

```deor
Roll best = empty    # transpiler error — empty is not valid for validator types
Roll best            # correct — starts as not valid
```

List shapes use `empty` instead — see [Variables — List Construction](docs/variables.md#list-construction).

---

## Replacing Null and Undefined

Older, C-style code marks "this might not be set" with a comment and a sentinel — a `-1`, a `NULL`, a `0` that quietly means "unset" — enforced by nothing but the reader remembering. Rust replaces that with `Option<T>`, fully enforced but asking you to learn and thread pattern-matching through code that, most of the time, never needed to hold "nothing" at all. Deor sits in between: most values can't be missing at all, and the rare ones that can require naming the concept as a `type` and writing its invalidity rule as real, checked code — the C comment, formalized, without Rust's full `Option` machinery.

There are two ways to use a validator type for this. Pick one interpretation per type — a real project wouldn't declare `ValidInt` both ways.

**Nothing means "not set yet"** — the predicate accepts anything, so the only way to be not valid is to never assign it:

```deor
type ValidInt(int val)
    true

ValidInt score          # not valid — nothing assigned, i.e. "null"
ValidInt score = 42     # valid — any int satisfies the predicate
```

`true` isn't a no-op here — it says "any assigned value is fine, only *absence* matters," leaning entirely on the declare-without-a-value mechanic above.

**A sentinel means "missing"** — the predicate itself rules out the value that stands for "nothing":

```deor
type ValidInt(int val)
    val is not 0

ValidInt count = 0      # not valid — 0 means "no count"
ValidInt count = 5      # valid
```

**Note:** It is always ideal to avoid making a generic validator type like this, as most types do have actual names like Temperature, which do have valid numbers they can't be (and are not always true), but for the rare case you actually need a generic nullable-ish type, this is the way to do it.

---

## Forced Unwrap — `avow`

`avow val` (or `(avow val)`) pulls the raw value out of a validator type — the plain `int` inside a `Roll`. It panics at runtime if the value isn't actually valid, so use it only when you're sure — typically right after an `if val is valid` check. (Rust readers: this is `.unwrap()`.) Using it on a non-validator-type variable is a transpiler error.

`avow` binds only to the next primary (identifier, literal, or parenthesized group) — same rule as `move` — so `avow val + 2` always parses as `(avow val) + 2`. Parens are a readability choice, not required.

Pass the variable directly (no `avow`) when a function accepts that validator type; only reach for `avow` when you need the raw primitive. It can be used as a function argument directly too (`show(avow roll)`), no need to capture it first.

```deor
Roll roll = roll_die(d20)
if roll is valid
    int val = (avow roll)          # need the raw int — use avow
    bool crit = is_critical(roll)  # function takes Roll — pass directly, no avow
```

```rust
if roll.is_some() {
    let val: i64 = roll.unwrap().0;
    let crit: bool = is_critical(roll);
}
```

Outside an `if` check, `avow` is your explicit assertion that the value is valid — `int sum = (avow value) + 2` works the same way, just without the safety net.

## Validator Types in Structs

Struct fields typed as a validator type are `Option<T>` under the hood. Extracting them with `in` preserves the Option — the extracted variable must be checked with `is valid` / `is not valid` before use.

```deor
struct Room
    Squarefeet area
    Roll max_capacity
```

```deor
(area, max_capacity) in room
if max_capacity is valid
    int cap = (avow max_capacity)
```

---

## Functions Returning Validator Types

A function returning a validator type returns a variable that may or may not be valid. To return a not-valid result, either declare the variable without a value and return it unassigned, or assign a value that fails the predicate. `return empty` and `return none` are both transpiler errors — neither is a Deor keyword in return position.

```deor
fn Roll find_best(int val)
    Roll best
    if val > 0
        best = val
    return best    # not valid if val <= 0
```

The caller checks with `is valid`:

```deor
Roll crit = find_best(val)
if crit is valid
    int bonus = (avow crit)
```

---

**Conversion notes:**
- Constructor becomes `fn new(n: T) -> Option<Self>` — never panics, returns `None` on predicate failure.
- `is valid` → `.is_some()`, `is not valid` → `.is_none()`.
- `(avow val)` → `.unwrap().0`.
- Equality (`is` / `is not`) transpiles to `==` / `!=` in Rust and falls through to `Option<T>: PartialEq` — `None == None` is true, `Some(x) == Some(y)` compares inner values structurally.
- `and` / `or` / `not` map to `&&` / `||` / `!`.
- The predicate always runs at runtime inside `new()` — even for literals like `Squarefeet area = -1`. There is no compile-time evaluation of the predicate, but it is runtime validated.
