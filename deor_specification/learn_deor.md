# Learning Deor
I will spend only a few words in this section, **please skip to the next heading if you are short on time**. 

My name is Nathan Hoffman, I am the creator behind Deor. I want this document to be useful for people coding for the first time and technical people, hence why I am using two blocks that can be ignored by either party "Newcomers" and "Techies". This language also serves as a great starting point for people who struggle learning Rust, as it transpiles to Rust, has some strong Rust similarities, and allows raw rust to be written inside of rust blocks.

To give you an idea of why I created Deor, you have to understand my background: I was born into a sea of Commodore Amiga hardware and software in the late 80s through mid-90s when my dad's computer store closed; throughout much of my life, I have loved programming, and anytime I move away from it, I come right back like a boomerang. I began with C and JavaScript the age of 13 in the early 2000s; I moved to PHP for fun in the mid-late 00s, and then finally landed programming as a career starting around 2014, so it would not be an exaggeration to say I have been coding for a quarter century. It wasn't all roses though, in the 2020s I started to have doubts about my programming career due to a series of personal struggles, yet even while questioning it my love was so strong I still did it as a career and for fun. In 2026 everything changed, and my code love grew so strong that it may be the pinnacle of my coding love: so when I say I can stand behind this language, know it does come from enthusiasm that has been building all my life, with an energy helped by AI learning. It takes me back to my days on my dad's Amiga looking at console text scroll across the startup console in wonder.

Note: While AI helped with some Deor code and documentation, **I have never had AI directly generate anything on this page** These are **my words**, thank you for spending the time to read them! :)

## 1. Storing Information: *(Compiler Implicit as)*
> **Newcomers**: Variables are portions of information, think names, numbers, and lists. If you tell a computer to say hello, it needs to know what hello is, not just how to say it. Variables have names that are used to reference the value in the code. For some values you just type the value (like numbers), for others which are hard for the computer to determine from the context, what are called strings (human writing), you use "" to wrap the string. 

```deor
times_to_say_hello as 10
i_should_say_hello as true
fahrenheit as 75.5
message as "hello, the temperature is "
```

You will see other ways to declare variables in this documentation, but ```as``` is best when the context of the value is obvious (like it is above) but when assigning things from outside as we will see later, it can be less obvious, in which case it is better to use the explicit type (covered next!)

> **Techies**: Although these assignments look implicit, they actually are validated by the compiler, and the Rust compiler will hard-fail if it can't determine a good type to assign. All variables also get clone() applied in the Rust output, the Rust compiler will strip away cloned copy-types (so there is no added performance cost for copy-types), but it exists to make dealing with reference-types like Strings, Structs, and Vectors easier for the user at a cost to performance. To avoid this performance hit, the move keyword exists to allow ownership, and rust blocks exist for manual control (more on these later)


## 2. Data Types: Primitives and Strings (1 of 2)
> **Newcomers**: Data types expose the underbelly of computers. They tell the computer how to manage their memory, this was more important back in the day (and remains today for high-performance applications), but even back in the 60s some programming languages like Fortran allowed omitting these, so don't feel bad if you don't like them. These "data types" tell the computer what is expected to be stored in the variable both for safety and memory regulation, and it can matter in some languages where smaller or bigger values were expected. The computer can't know what information is coming from outside, and so it can't know how to prepare storage for it, afterall. By providing computers the type they can both guard against bad data being processed and improve performance by limiting how much memory is reserved for that value. Fahrenheit is obviously never going to be 1,000 trillion on Earth, but a computer (and non-Americans ;) ) don't know that! Deor simplifies things by making the default for these types very large, so 99.99% of the time you don't need to worry about it, and for safety the Rust code Deor generates is already safe: so the only real remaining factors are clarity and communicating expectations.

```deor
int times_to_say_hello = 7
bool i_should_say_hello = true
float fahrenheit = 75.5
string message = "hello, the temperature is "
```

The symbol = is used instead of as, a hold-over from older languages like C to make the convention more familiar to programmers who know what data types are, allowing newcomers to use the simpler syntax ```as```, or techies to reserve ```as``` when declarations are obvious like our literal values.
- ```int``` is a whole number (comes from math: integer)
- ```bool``` short for boolean, a true/false value (comes from George Boole, a founder of logical/discrete mathematics)
- ```float``` is a decimal value (it comes from the name floating-point calculation, basically a storage form of scientific notation) and can be inaccurate to use for extremely heavy amounts of math and financial data over many transactions due to limits of storage and binary accuracy. For regular day applications, you don't need to worry it has an accuracy of ~16 digits.
- ```string``` a portion of human-text comes from (a string of characters) a hold-over from early languages like C which treated strings as lists of individual characters.

> **Techies**: Floats use Double Precision 64-bit, and Integers use long precision 64-bit. This decision was made due to modern hardware and because it vastly simplifies types, for more explicit types you can use rust blocks. In Rust strings are stored on the heap, which makes them expandable. However, this also means they are reference-types and are the only of these types not to be a copy-type. Deor does its best to disguise this fact by to_string list borrows everytime it is met, this can be an expensive operation as the heap and pointer are both cloned.

## 3. Comments
> **Newcomers**: Time to relax after that nonsense about low level stuff! This is the easiest section of all, comments are just for the coders benefit, they are literally stripped away by the computer, it doesn't care about them at all, which is why most highlighters make them fade into the background!
```deor
# this is a comment so I can say whatever I want!

# let us go back to using as for these `primitive` values, they are obvious, and simple!
times_to_say_hello as 7  # this is a prime number, fun fact!
i_should_say_hello as true
fahrenheit as 75.5

# strings can be weird, as we will see, so we will keep explicit typing to differentiate it
string message = "hello, the temperature is "
```
Comments are applied with the # symbol, called "hash".  They can be applied above (Deor best practice) but they can also be put to the side as well.
> **Techies**: There is no block-comment, just use # for everything

## 4. If Statement (1 of 2)
> **Newcomers**: We are about to embark on our first bit of logic, code that does something! If statements are logical conditions, just as they read in english.  If statements are essential in programming languages for asking "should this code actually run?" If the statement (the condition to the right of the if) is true, then the code in the block below it runs. If it is false, it is skipped. The block below the code is a "tabbed-block" think of it like a nested level where anything with a tab below it is considered inside of that block, and will run.

```deor
times_to_say_hello as 7
i_should_say_hello as true
fahrenheit as 75.5

string message = "hello, the temperature is "

if i_should_say_hello is true
    print(message)  # prints: hello, the temperature is 

```
If takes a boolean value, which can also be a comparison (which returns a boolean value) which is what we see here. The equality comparison uses: ```is true``` which asks "is this statement true."  There is also an ```is false``` for the opposite. Like math there is order of operations so you could also have said ```if (i_should_say_hello is true)``` which could be necessary if you had more is and is nots. Additionally ```is true``` is optional here, since our variable is already a boolean (true/false) we could just replace this with ```if i_should_say_hello``` which would do the same thing.

Deor uses tabbed-blocks which just means that when you need to make code a "child" of something else, you tab it below it, everything on that same tab-level lives at the same level of nesting or resides in the same "block".

The print you see here, prints to the terminal, and is explained in the next section.

> **Techies**: If uses the else if / else standard pattern, to not overwhelm new readers it is not mentioned here, proceed to If Statement: Else (2 of 2) for detail.

## 5. Built In Functions (1 of 2)
> **Newcomers**: We haven't discussed what functions are, don't worry about that. Just think of them as little units of work, you will end up defining some of your own soon enough! Built-Ins are, as the name suggests, built into the language as helpers to make your job easier. You already saw how print() works, that is one of the built-in functions as seen below.

```deor
times_to_say_hello as 7
i_should_say_hello as true
fahrenheit as 75.5

string message = "hello, the temperature is "
print(message) 
# prints: hello, the temperature is

len(message)

error as "Oh no, the temperature is less than absolute 0!"
crash(error)
# crashes the program with the error: Oh no, the temperature is less than absolute 0!
```
Built-ins:
- print() prints the string to the terminal
- len() outputs an int as to the length of the string (or list, once we get to that section)
- crash() hard crashes the entire program with the string error message provided



## Built In Functions (2 of 2)
Built-ins that will be discussed in the future (you can ignore for now):
- input() allows input to be taken in from the terminal
- args() same as input but used for function arguments 
- range() not yet discussed and specific to for loops, see the for sections for more


## 6. Data Types: Structs  (2 of 4)
> **Newcomers**: So far we have left out only three more data types: structs, lists

## 7. Data Types: Lists and Shapes  (3 of 4)
> **Newcomers**: So far we have left out only three more data types: structs, lists

Shapes are used to declare what other languages call "generics". These are types that rely on other types. Think about a list. A list is a type, but a list itself doesn't tell us what is inside of it. A shape does, and allows us to alias it with a human readable syntax. 

Shapes can also define func (which are basically functions stored as variables). The func shape is really quite complex, and is covered later on, but I provided the definition here for documentation clarity. Func are an advanced feature and are covered at the very end of this documentation. Most of the times you encounter shapes in this documentation it will be for defining list types.

# 20. You are done the basics! Only Advanced Features Remain
> **Newcomers**: You did it! Nice, thanks so much for reading, it is an honor of mine to help you learn to code! If I ever had another job, it would be being a programming teacher.  You have greatly honored me by partaking in this journey.

You have completed this documentation page, only one more remains on advanced features if you want to read it, advanced features covers:
- First Class Functions (Func)
- Rust Blocks
- Lib Wrappers / Rust Interop
- Integration with Cargo

> **Techies**: Let me know what you think of my programming language, and I strongly encourage you to check out the advanced page
